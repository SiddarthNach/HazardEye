# HazardEye Deployment Force Update
# This file forces Render to use the latest code

# Deployment timestamp: 2025-07-27T02:40:22Z
# Git commit: f46d95b
# Purpose: Force cache invalidation and use latest app.py with robust imports

# Critical files status:
# - app.py: Updated with robust import fallback
# - utils.py: Updated with safe try/catch imports
# - utils_fallback.py: Production-ready fallback module
# - requirements.txt: Lightweight without ultralytics

# Expected behavior:
# 1. App should try utils_fallback first (line 8 in new app.py)
# 2. If utils_fallback fails, try utils (line 11 in new app.py) 
# 3. Both modules now have safe imports for ultralytics
# 4. App should start successfully with OpenCV-based analysis
