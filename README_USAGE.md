- **Lane Detection**: Analyzes lane positions, curves, and driving patterns
- **Pothole Detection**: Uses YOLOv8 AI to identify potholes in real-time
- Progress indicator shows real-time processing status

### 5. Review Comprehensive Results

#### Safety Score (0-100)
- **80-100**: ‚úÖ LOW RISK - Excellent driving, no major hazards
- **60-79**: ‚ö†Ô∏è MEDIUM RISK - Some concerns detected
- **40-59**: üö® HIGH RISK - Multiple issues or hazards  
- **0-39**: üÜò CRITICAL RISK - Serious safety concerns

#### Key Metrics
- **Lane Detection Success Rate**: Percentage of frames with successful lane detection
- **üï≥Ô∏è Potholes Detected**: Total number of potholes identified
- **Curve Warnings**: Percentage of frames with sharp curves (< 500m radius)
- **Center Deviation**: Percentage of frames with significant lane position deviation (> 1.0m)
- **Pothole Risk Frames**: Percentage of frames containing potholes

#### Analyzed Video
- Download the processed video with lane detection overlays and pothole annotations
- Visual indicators show detected lanes, curves, position information, and pothole locations

## Dual Safety Scoring Algorithm

The app uses a weighted scoring system prioritizing road hazards over driving patterns:

**Scoring Weights:**
- **üï≥Ô∏è Pothole Detection: 70%** (Primary safety factor)
- **üõ£Ô∏è Lane Detection: 30%** (Secondary driving factor)

### Pothole Component (70% weight):
- **Base Penalty**: 50 points for any pothole detection
- **Density Penalties**:
  - >5% frames with potholes: Additional 40 points (90 total)
  - >2% frames with potholes: Additional 30 points (80 total)  
  - >1% frames with potholes: Additional 20 points (70 total)
  - <1% frames with potholes: Additional 10 points (60 total)
- **Absolute Count**: 0.5 points per pothole (max 30 points)
- **Risk Levels**: Based primarily on pothole count
  - 20+ potholes: CRITICAL
  - 10+ potholes: HIGH
  - 5+ potholes: MEDIUM

### Lane Component (30% weight):
- **Lane Detection Success**: Base score multiplied by success rate
- **Curve Analysis**: 30-point penalty scale for sharp curves
- **Position Deviation**: 25-point penalty scale for off-center driving
- **Consistency Factors**: Additional penalties for poor driving patterns

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Import Errors**
   ```bash
   # Ensure all dependencies are installed
   pip install streamlit opencv-python numpy sqlite3
   ```

2. **Video Upload Issues**
   - Check file format (MP4, AVI, MOV)
   - Ensure file size is reasonable (< 100MB recommended)
   - Verify file is not corrupted

3. **Lane Detection Problems**
   - Works best with clear lane markings
   - Adequate lighting conditions improve results
   - Highway/road videos work better than city traffic

4. **Pothole Detection Issues**
   - Model works best on clear road surface videos
   - Lighting and resolution affect detection accuracy
   - Some false positives may occur with shadows or road marks

5. **Performance Issues**
   - Processing time depends on video length and resolution
   - Dual analysis (lane + pothole) takes longer than lane-only
   - Consider using shorter clips for testing

### Test the Installation
```bash
python test_app.py
